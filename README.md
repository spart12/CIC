## How to Play
### Needed
52 card deck; two to four players.
### Deal
Four cards are dealt to each player. Once the players have played all four cards, the dealer will deal out another four cards to each player, two cards at a time. This is repeated until all cards have been dealt.
### Game Play
During game play, the players will try to take in as many cards as they can in order to win as many points as they can. 
When a combination is built, players can continue to build up the combination.
### Moves
#### Build
This move is created when a card from a player’s hand is combined with a card in the middle. This can only be done if the combined total equals the value of a card in that player’s hand.
#### Call
It's combining cards with an equal value. This can only be done if the player has a card of equal value in still in his hand.
#### Take
Cards can be taken by pairing a card from your hand to a card that is in the middle. Multiple cards from the middle can be added together and taken by a card that equals their total value. 
For example, a 7 from a player’s hand can take a 3 and 4 from the middle.
#### Drop
It's means placing a card from his/her hand into the middle.
